# Contributing to Pyro

Thank you for your interest in Pyro! We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code changes.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyro.git
cd pyro 
```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate    
```


4. Install the package in editable mode with test dependencies:

```
    pip install -e .
    pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

5. Running Tests

```
pytest tests/ -v --cov=pyro
```

## Code Style

-    Follow PEP 8 for Python code.

-    Use meaningful variable names.

-    Add docstrings to public functions and classes.

-    Keep the compiler modular: lexer → parser → transformer.

## How to Add a New Feature

1. **Lexer**: Add new token types in pyro/lexer.py (update KEYWORDS, TOKEN_REGEX if needed).

2. **Parser**: Add new grammar rules in pyro/parser.py and new AST node classes in pyro/ast_nodes.py.

3. **Transformer**: Implement code generation for the new AST node in pyro/transformer.py.

4. **Tests**: Write tests in tests/ for the new feature.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch from main:
    
```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name    
```

2. Make your changes, add tests, and ensure all tests pass.

3. Commit with a clear message:
    
```
git commit -m "Add support for ..."
```

4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against main.

## Reporting Issues

Use the GitHub issue tracker. Please include:

-    A minimal example of Pyro code that reproduces the issue.
